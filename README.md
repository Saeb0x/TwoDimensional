TwoDimensional is a cross-platform, high performance 2D game engine currently in development.

This game engine is a layer of software that's built on top of SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. It's designed as a system of reusable 
components that facilitate 2D video games creation. It's simple but effective. It should be flexible and easy to expand upon.
